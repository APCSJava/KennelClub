# KennelClub
A project for working with abstract classes, methods, and inheritance (AP CS 2004 FRQ)

# Instructions
Using pencil and paper:
* Write the class declaration for Cat, including its constructor and methods
* Write the class declaration for LoudDog, including its constructor and methods.  Note: You ARE NOT REQUIRED to write a class declaration for the Dog class at this time although you SHOULD consider that class when implementing LoudDog.
* Write an implementation for the allSpeak() method specified in the Kennel class.  Note: The original question collected the pets in an ArrayList, which we have not yet studied; therefore, the pets are here collected in an array of Pet references.  The basic process of iterating through a collection remains consistent.  This is THE ONLY instance I have found where the College Board specifically requested that students print to the console.

Clone the starter code from http://github.com/APCSJava/KennelClub:
* Compile the Pet class
* Write and compile the Cat class
* Write and compile the  Dog class
* Write and compile the LoudDog class
* Implement the allSpeak() method of the Kennel class and compile
* Compile and run KennelTester
* Share your results with me
 
 Food for thought: (be prepared to discuss)
 * In the Kennel class, why would it present a problem if we are unable to assign an animal to a cage?  What are some ways we might modify our code to address this issue?
 * Why do you suppose the original question used an ArrayList instead of an Array?
 * How is polymorphism being demonstrated through inheritance?  Where else have we encountered polymorphism?  How is this similar/different?
 *
